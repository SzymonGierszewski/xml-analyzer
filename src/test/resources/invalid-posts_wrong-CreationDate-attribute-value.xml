         Body="&lt;p&gt;For both of the main potential audiences of this site, I think we should include the regional dialects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For native speakers, the regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today.  For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions.  But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine.  (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.  These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences.  So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"
